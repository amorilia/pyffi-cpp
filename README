Fixing up expat config include:
* Copy expat_config.h to the expat directory
* Run
find . -not -wholename "*svn*" -and -name "*.c" -exec perl -pi -w -e 's/<expat_config.h>/"expat_config.h"/g' {} \;

Installing boost on windows with mingw32:
* unzip and compile bjam "build.bat mingw"
* to make sure that bjam can compile python_boost, install python, and put the following lines in a file C:\Users\<yourusername>\user-config.jam

import toolset : using ;
using python
   : 2.5
   : c:\\Python25\\python.exe
   : c:\\Python25\\include
   : c:\\Python25\\libs
   ;

* unzip the boost sources
* run bjam in the source directory, with the following options
..\boost-jam-3.1.17\bin.ntx86\bjam.exe --toolset=gcc --layout=system link=shared runtime-link=shared threading=single variant=release install
* wait a while... the sources and libs will be installed in C:\Boost
* if you are happy with the installation, move C:\Boost\include\boost to C:\MinGW\include\boost
and copy all libraries from C:\Boost\lib to C:\MinGW\lib (or, add the include and bin directories to
your mingw's specs file); you can delete the C:\Boost directory
