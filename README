Installing boost on windows with mingw32 and cmake:
* checkout boost from http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/trunk into xxx/src/
* create empty directory xxx/build/
* run cmake
  - unselect "bcp"
  - unselect "wserialization"
  - unselect "debug"
  - unselect "multithreaded"
  - unselect "quickbook"
  - select "release"
  - select "shared"
  - select "singlethreaded"
  - unselect "static"
  - unselect "testing"
  - unselect "versioned"
  - in advanced settings, check the python paths
* run mingw32-make in the build dir
* if you are happy with the compilation, copy xxx/src/boost to C:\MinGW\include\boost
and copy all libraries from xxx/build/lib to C:\MinGW\lib
* to run any executable linked with MinGW, you need to put the correct dll files from xxx/build/bin
into the directory of the executable
